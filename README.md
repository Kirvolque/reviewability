# reviewability

A tool that scores the reviewability of code changes.

## The Idea

A diff can be hard to review not because the code is bad, but because the
*representation* of the change obscures **what** happened. A block moved and
reindented looks like a wall of red and green even if nothing changed logically.
Unlike linters, it does not analyze the code — only the diff as a whole.

It computes metrics at the level of individual hunks, files, and the whole diff,
feeding into **Reviewability Scores** (0.0 = hardest, 1.0 = easiest) with
configurable thresholds for what counts as problematic.

## Key Concepts

- **Hunk** — a contiguous block of changes within a single file (the smallest unit of analysis)
- **Metric** — a calculated value attached to a hunk, a file, or the whole diff
- **Score** — a float [0.0, 1.0] representing reviewability at hunk, file, or diff level

## Extensibility

The metric system is designed to be extended:

- **Add a metric** — subclass `HunkMetric`, `FileMetric`, or `OverallMetric`, implement `calculate()`, register via `registry.add()`
- **Adjust scoring** — provide a custom `ReviewabilityScorer` implementation, or tune the weights in `WeightedReviewabilityScorer`
- **Adjust thresholds** — edit `reviewability.toml` to change what score counts as problematic and what limits trigger violations

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze a range of commits
reviewability HEAD~1 HEAD

# Analyze from stdin
git diff HEAD~1 | reviewability --from-stdin

# Use a custom config
reviewability --config path/to/reviewability.toml HEAD~1 HEAD
```

## Research

Metrics are grounded in peer-reviewed research on code review effectiveness:
